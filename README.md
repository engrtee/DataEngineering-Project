# DataEngineering-Project


The aim of this project is to build a simple data engineering project which entails creating a data model, performing data cleansing with python, creating tables in MySQL using Python, and loading the data into the database. 



The purpose of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide for setting up and running the project successfully.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, please ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python 3.x
MySQL server
Additionally, an internet connection is required to download the dataset.




The data model is provided above. Alternatively, it can be recreated using tools like Lucidchart or other data modeling software.
Code Execution:

The code for table creation, data cleansing, and data loading can be found in the main Jupyter file. Execute the code sequentially to perform the necessary tasks.

Contributions are welcome! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please submit a pull request or open an issue in the repository.
